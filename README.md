### Hello there !  
Thank you for checking out my GitHub profil !  
Here you will find multiple repositories showing which courses I followed to learn programming.  
Here are the different courses I followed and wrote code for:  
- IBM Data Science : EdX
- Harvard Data Science : EdX
- Python bootcamp : 42AI  
  
I am also very keen on building interactive Jupyter Notebooks to teach physics.  
On top of Jupyter Notebooks I am also looking at Geogebra to play with interactive geometries.

My futur projects include :
- Machine Learning bootcamp : 42AI
- Juypter Notebooks
